Dependencies: Bullet physics engine, irrKlang sound library

Compile: Use .sln file

Features: Integrated with Bullet physics engine,  nice mini map, 'smart' AIs

How to play:
	Use 'W' to move forward, 'S' to move backward, 'A' to rotate to left, 'D' to rotate to right.
	'Space' to spawn mines, 'left mouse button' to fire a shell, 'right mouse button' to fire a missle.

	Shells will explode when it hitted anything.
	Missles only explode when it hitted AI tanks, and will bounce back when it hitted anything else. So fire a missle will guarantee an AI tank be killed.
	Enjoy :)
